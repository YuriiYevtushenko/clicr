The tentative turnaround time for orders less than 100 images is up to 12 business days from the time we receive your products and payment. Reach our support to get better insight.

                            <p className='global__text faq__container__desc'>Thatâ€™s totally up to you. If you want the product back, then you have to include that option in registration time. Else, it will be stored in our storage and you can pick that whenever you wish.

                            <p className='global__text faq__container__desc'>Sorry, we currently do not support that under any pricing scheme. Usually any other person than the creative team is not allowed to attend the phototshoot. Otherwise, it has effects on others and time & effort get wasted as we conduct the process on a fixed plan. We hope that people would understand and respect our creative process.

                            <p className='global__text faq__container__desc'>Yes, based on the pricing plan, you will have several revision options. If you want to bring more than 90% change, then you will have to pay further.
